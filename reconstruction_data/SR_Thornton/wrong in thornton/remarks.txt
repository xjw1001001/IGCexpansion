The first error is that in the 20_Table S7.pdf, Anguilla japonica.
You can see that the ERa and ERb have the same accesion number. That's the mistake #1
The second and third error are the two protein named CanFamERa and HapBurAr.
in the differences.fasta, it is that two protein and the protein fasta downloaded by the accesion number in 20_Table S7.pdf.
And the aligned.fasta is the mafft result. It shows that there must be some mistake.
